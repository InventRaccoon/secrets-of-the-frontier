The hollow eyes keep silent vigil. Stacks and wings and arches and forests of human bone adorn every surface. The dust-flux pulses slowly, like the breath of a titanic creature.

An odd aching comes over you, spreading across your body from one side.

It directs you to a tiny flicker of blue light, far down a dark maintenance passage.

A horrible cold comes over you, like everwinter's chill.","sotf_killaShrineInvestigateH:Brave the passage

At its end, you find a tight storage section, once part of a greater space that was torn apart and then welded into another ship's structure during the shrine's creation.

On the floor sits a human skull, impaled into the floor by a blinking emergency beacon and two coiled metal rods.

Thrice-speared. You know well what it means, what it represents.","sotf_killaShrineHonorIdolH:Try and make amends

In this place so divorced from everything, with only the gentle creaking of the warped hulls around you, all you have are your thoughts.

And yet, you watched. Observed. Judged. You are never alone, not anymore. Not after what you've done.

One day, you may find some tiny sliver of peace.

But it will never be here, and you know in your heart you will never be free of the wraith that hunts you.",lpp_killaShrineFirstLeaveStart:Leave hurriedly for your shuttle,

It dislodges from the hole in the floor it rests in, taking half the skull with it. The rods lose their careful balance, and topple with a loud clatter. Cacophony echoes throughout the shrine.

The tension in your heart builds, and the cold becomes worse.

What little relief this act brought you fades in seconds.

Things will be much worse now. This you know for sure.",lpp_killaShrineFirstLeaveStart:Leave for your shuttle,
