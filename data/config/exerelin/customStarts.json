You did whatever it took to rise to your height of power, leaving a trail of broken souls, oaths of vengeance and an unholy headcount.\n\nEven with a number of eyes in the shadows and many subordinates too afraid to turn against you, a miscalculation in a fringe system provided the perfect opportunity, and taking control of the better part of your fleet, your second decided to leave you an infamous blip in history.\n\nBegin with a small band of pirate loyalists. Your great potential still lingers in the form of an extra skill point, but you're forever hunted by a 'malevolent spirit' that possesses hostile ships to grant them unusual abilities.",

This hobby brings you... strange associates.\n\nA chance salvage expedition, bargaining on a drunken spacer's good word, brought you to your most fruitful meeting yet, the tip a dead end but leading you to a dying soul in need of your aid. Since then you've forged a camaraderie, and soon you may learn the truth of your silent friend's cause.\n\nBegin as a small salvor fleet with a loyal ally, her kin's favor and the ability to recover her unusual style of ship.",
