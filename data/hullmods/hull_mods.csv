Additional shielding and insulation around its cables allow it to sustain greater traction during operation.

This augment allows the Concord to handle higher levels of hard flux, increasing the threshold at which speed bottoms out by %s. The base threshold is %s, and the enhanced insulation takes it to %s, causing hard-flux-stress to never reach its most debilitating levels.",Reduces impact of hard flux level on top speed while phased.,,graphics/hullmods/sotf_serenity.png

Reduces the phase cloak's activation cost to %s. Increases the soft flux dissipation and weapon recharge rate by %s while phased.

When suffering critical damage that would otherwise destroy or disable the ship, it is able to initiate an emergency dive deep into p-space, immediately retreating from combat but suffering an additional penalty to combat readiness equal to %s its deployment cost. The ship must have enough combat readiness to cover this cost to initiate the dive.

This ship's phase dive does not prevent ships with %s from also initiating phase dives due to the unusual frequencies of the disturbances caused.","Increases flux dissipation and weapon recharge while phased, emergency dive maneuver.",,graphics/hullmods/sotf_fervor.png
