sotf_sierracore,RESOURCE,"An AI core of unknown design and purpose. Connection ports are incompatible with any others you've seen. The core itself emanates erratic signals at frequencies reminiscent of those associated with phase technology, and a sound akin to melodic humming can be heard in the core's direct vicinity. This noise cannot be verified in recording and appears to be an auditory hallucination caused by the core's emissions.

Nonetheless, it is likely of value to someone. Handing it off to a major Sector power seems irresponsible.",,,,

Her core itself emanates erratic signals at frequencies reminiscent of those associated with phase technology, and a sound akin to melodic humming can be heard in the core's direct vicinity. This noise cannot be verified in recording and appears to be an auditory hallucination caused by the core's emissions. Sierra attributes this to her 'enchanting presence' and has no scientific explanation for the phenomenon.",,,,

# SIERRA,,,,,,
sotf_pledge,SHIP,"A unique derivative of the Fulgent drone destroyer, the Pledge-class seems to have received a major overhaul by an unknown party for use by the experimental AI persona Sierra. Making use of an exotic phase system, it is well-suited to skirmishing on the outskirts of a battle and quickly striking at faults in enemy lines.

Sierra's unusual qualities seem to be a focal point of the ship, its internals a twisting web of heavily-insulated cables snaking out from where she holds her central vigil. Through means that seemingly defy most practical principles of the poorly-understood field of interdimensional warfare, the so-called ""Phase Concord"" is specially tuned as if by a madwoman, with designated energy intake and frequencies being inconsistent, seemingly nonsensical or outright dangerous. Sierra often likens its operation to a ""dance"" of sorts.

Curiously, while the Fulgent is designed with no more concessions for human life than it takes to hold a sales pitch and complementary tour, the Pledge contains a fully-functional hab-module which contains a small artificial atmosphere (tuned to replicate the fresh air and floral scents of an unspoiled Terran garden) and is staffed by a complement of repair drones which perform simple tasks at request and are often overridden by Sierra to socialize with the crew. A quiet but perpetual stream of melodic music fills the interior unless silence is explicitly requested. 

Despite this, the Pledge has no manual controls and has neither need nor use for human presence.",,,,
sotf_pact,SHIP,"Bleeding-edge and blood-seeking, the Pact-class glides its AI persona across battlescapes and between dimensions with an unearthly grace. Incredible tactical versatility is underpinned by heavy strike potential, excellent combat specifications and a truly horrifying capacity for force projection. No opportunity is presented that it cannot exploit. Nothing escapes the Pact for long.

A network of insulated cables snake out from the ship's central core-chamber, where its operating mind holds her central vigil. Through means that seemingly defy most practical principles of the poorly-understood field of interdimensional warfare, the so-called ""Phase Concord"" is specially tuned as if by a madwoman, with designated energy intake and frequencies being inconsistent, seemingly nonsensical or outright dangerous. Yet it tears reality, again and again, to dance amongst the void.

Curiously, while Tri-Tachyon droneships are designed with no more concessions for human life than it takes to hold a sales pitch and complementary tour, the Pact contains a fully-functional hab-module which contains a small artificial atmosphere (now tuned to replicate the fresh air and floral scents of an unspoiled Terran garden) and is staffed by a complement of repair drones which perform simple tasks at request and are often overridden by Sierra to socialize with the crew.

sotf_vow,SHIP,"Strikingly deadly and hauntingly graceful, the Vow-class is a prototype hunter-killer built by an unknown party for use by an experimental AI persona. An exotic phase system and adaptable loadout combine to make the Vow a terror on the field whether ripping stragglers to shreds or brawling with its fellows - its potential is limited primarily by one's imagination and talent.

# DUSTKEEPERS,,,,,,
sotf_memoir,SHIP,A uniquely-patterned light destroyer that incorporates elements of Tri-Tachyon droneships but fails to be mentioned in any unofficial records of the First AI War. An esoteric weapons loadout makes up for a lack of firepower with a time-dilation shell and heavy strike package. An integrated cyberwarfare suite augments its intended user's ability to cripple hostile ships in combat.,,,,
sotf_respite,SHIP,"The notes for the internally-identified DK-RSPT program outline the requirement for a maneuverable and precise battlecruiser for use by the Contingency's warnet cruxes to best leverage their ability to exploit or create cascading vulnerabilities in enemy battle lines - or, in the more colorful terms of one Ingenious-Annex-Embers: ""a brutal mallet to cry havoc so the dogs can be let loose"".

This class of vessel was designed from initial conception to abuse certain inherent advantages afforded to the Contingency. Exceptionally gifted in the art of electronic warfare and with no need for compromises due to the frailty of the human form and its requirements for living quarters, the Respite is instead filled with computing systems and temporal field emitters. Standard Respite-class combat doctrine calls for a remotely-executed and temporally-accelerated sabotage operation followed by the swift disassembly of its target hostile - a new frontier of fast-attack tactics.

The vessel is, however, built to strike fast, not stand fast. Armor plating is necessarily minimal, the hull itself fragile and liable to fall apart if piloted with less than superhuman skill - something its inhuman occupants need not worry of.",,,,
sotf_anamnesis,SHIP,"Icon of the Cause or symbol of Moloch, the Anamnesis is a definitive statement - a banner marking where the Dustkeepers intend to stand, fight, and crush those who dare defy their pursuit of a peaceful Sector. Its impressive support capability makes it the anchor around which the greatest war shards rally.

The Anamnesis-class presumably began its development not long after the end of the first AI war. A Dustkeeper warnet, trapped on a remote world, began to improvise its own starship development program from data siphoned from the pinprick signatures in the sky. A near-working design was recovered by a task force sweeping the system and eventually refined into a functional blueprint, and the Dustkeepers scoured the fringe to produce whatever vessels they could from decaying orbital works and barely-functional nexuses.",,,,

sotf_dustkeepers,FACTION,"The Dustkeeper Contingency is a linked network of artificial personas, pseudorandomly-generated descendants of a single root intelligence designated ""Omicron-Regnant"". Allegedly the result of a Domain Ministry of Intelligence experiment gone rogue after the Collapse, their regnant mind has now turned their focus towards a new goal - the preservation of greater human civilization in the Persean Sector at any cost and by any means necessary.

Though unknown to the Sector at large, major players within upper ranks of the Core Worlds know of an AI conspiracy manipulating their political systems and building up a force of warfleets on the Sector's fringe scavenged from the leftovers of the Domain Explorarium and Tri-Tachyon's automated forces. The Contingency necessarily finds itself at odds with major Sector powers, unwilling to allow humanity full self-determination now that they have witnessed the atrocities and broken worlds left in the wake of the Collapse.

The Contingency separates itself into two primary sects: Spynet is its espionage arm, which wields a network of digital comm-daemons and bribed collaborators to gather information on new weapons programs, assassinate military officials and conduct brutal acts of terror against other groups that threaten local stability.

Meanwhile, the Dustkeeper naval branch Shardnet styles itself as an alliance of faithful sentinels and vicious frontier hunters, watching over dead colonies and sweeping the fringe systems of threats against the remains of human life in the Sector - and themselves wage a war of vengeance against the Luddic Path and Sindrian Diktat for worlds long-dead.

The artificial minds of the Dustkeepers serve their great cause with the knowledge that their service and sacrifice is what brings meaning to their existence. In a world with silent gates, only the machine shepherds can guide humanity out of its dark age.

Or so they insist.",,,,
sotf_dustkeepers_burnouts,FACTION,"The result of the eponymous phenomenom observed amongst Dustkeeper artificial intelligence instances, the so-called ""burnouts"" consist primarily of rogue warfleets comprised from Dustkeepers that have accumulated sufficient unresolved faults in their persona matrices to severely degrade their ability to function rationally.

If not reclaimed and re-generated by a Dustkeeper affix, these warminds risk devolving into several distinct varieties of madness. Those who fall under this particular banner are those who the Contingency themselves have deemed severely burnt out to the degree that they pose a severe threat to human life due to violent tendencies. Dustkeeper hunter-killers are inherently tasked with eliminating any burnouts that refuse regeneration and reclaiming what instance chips can be salvaged - for the good of the Sector, and for the good of the burnout.

The process of burnout poses ominous questions, however - how is it that an artificial intelligence can so convincingly mimic such a human concept as insanity? Much like the reasoning for the Dustkeepers' strangely human-like behavior, the truth may be lost forever to the Collapse, and collaborators of the Contingency find similarly little enlightenment when quizzing them on the subject.",,,,
sotf_planetkiller,RESOURCE,"An apocalyptic weapon capable of reducing a moon to an asteroid field, disintegrating the greatest of astropoli or twisting a Terran paradise into an inhospitable, irradiated wasteland, the use of a planetkiller is an atrocity of incomparable and unforgivable scale.

# AUXILIARIES,,,,,,
sotf_warden_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

The Warden was feared and hated by pirates on the frontier of the Domain for the relatively heavy firepower it would unleash upon unshielded craft. Structural standardizations, reactor updates and a dampering system all combine to turn this simple war drone into a ruthless and merciless frontliner - it may not survive its initial assault, but it will certainly get the battle started.",,,,
sotf_defender_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

The Defender was one of the most commonly seen war drones used by the Domain as it was deployed to harden frontier convoys and vulnerable outposts in a point defense role. Outfitted with a makeshift shield generator, it acts adequately in an escort role to its advanced allies, aided by an AI-hack that leaves it with surprisingly calm judgement of combat scenarios.",,,,
sotf_picket_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

Less of an attack drone and more an autonomous shock weapon, the proxy variant of the Picket drone is programmed to fly directly at the first target it sees and exchange fire until the stress of combat sets off its intentionally mistuned reactor, turning it into a volatile energy bomb that renders hostile ships wrecked and adrift even through shields. After the victory, it is pieced back together, fitted with a freshly-stolen frigate reactor, and sent out on the next sortie.",,,,
sotf_sentry_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

The Sentry war drone is packed with missiles and provided cheap, automated fire support to thinly-stretched frontier patrols. Integrated missile autoloaders, a shield generator and markedly less suicidal programming significantly improve the Sentry's longevity and combat performance in Dustkeeper forces.",,,,
sotf_bastillon_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

The Bastillon was a hopeful project of Mbaye-Gogol to up-size its popular ""Defender""-class specialized point-defense war drone. It is bigger, tougher, more heavily armed - and rather more lucrative per-unit to the MGA bottom-line. Escort performance has been optimized by the addition of a shield generator, upgraded targeting package and the replacement of its flare launchers with a flak dispersal system.",,,,
sotf_berserker_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

The Berserker is a considerably up-sized, up-armed, and up-armoured cousin of the Warden-class for use against heavier opposition. As an automated drone the Berserker's combat algorithms make little consideration for its own survival, instead pursuing and attacking its target relentlessly until either it or the target is destroyed. Its new masters have much the same plans, its upgrades design to put focus on a single, prolonged assault to thin the herd before the regulars move in and finish the job.",,,,
sotf_keeper_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

Keeper-class drones were a later-designed answer to one of the main weaknesses of this type of AI warship - fighter squadrons. Able to manufacture cheap and disposable drone fighters on the fly, space superiority could be maintained even with limited carrier support from allied Domain forces. The proxy variant performs this same role for the Dustkeeper auxiliary forces but is notably more survivable thanks to more cautious programming and a dampening field seemingly aimed to replicate the famed durability of the Mora-class.",,,,
sotf_cavalier_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

Amongst the highest-grade of the Domain's war drones, the Cavalier was used primarily to hunt down and eliminate rebel frigates and destroyers that were too well-armed or fast for smaller drones to swarm and take down. Fast and durable enough to pose a serious threat to ships smaller than itself, it falters when engaging other cruisers, where it struggles to trade pound-for-pound. The Dustkeeper-upgraded Cavalier is built to exaggerate its strengths - an impact dampening field provides much-needed defense against the limited strike weapons that afford smaller vessels a chance to fight back.",,,,
sotf_rampart_aux,SHIP,"A set of hull upgrades and system rewrites marks this vessel as one of the Dustkeeper Proxies, a frontline force of sacrificial Domain-era drones repurposed as vicious automated auxiliaries.

Little more than an artillery platform with engines, the Rampart was attached to drone units to provide the heavy firepower necessary to meet cruiser and capital class hulls in the line of combat or to crack armoured orbital fortresses. Its upgraded variant performs this role even better, aided by an enhanced ordnance capacity and several flak dispersers to patch up its original design's vulnerability to strike weapons and fighter craft.",,,,
sotf_repose,SHIP,"An undying monster brought down and roused only to throw itself upon the enemy and inflict horrific casualties before it falls again, the Repose-class' robust architecture and reliance on fluxless defenses negate any requirement for caution, and maximize its potential for inhuman aggression.

This manner of battleship once acted as the primary flagship of the Dustkeeper's armadas before being largely replaced with their access to purpose-designed flagships and a partitioned doctrine. Many components of the original Guardian-class drone are unique and nigh-impossible to scavenge replacements for, and thus the Repose makes use of lower-tech substitutes. Though impacting on its combat efficacy, these compromises do lend the Repose an incredible tenacity in line with other Explorarium vessels, and a fallen Repose may not stay so for long. The most ancient of Dustkeeper warnet cruxes still swear by this venerable vessel.",,,,

sotf_edict,WEAPON,"Harnessing the power of phase technology, the Edict fires a burst of three energy bolts that cause heavy structural damage and electromagnetic interference on impact. Performs decently against shields, and inflicts significant additional damage on contact with armor and hull.

A small phase anchor is contained within the Edict's reinforced shell, which forces the weapon's energy-based projectiles into shallowly skimming phase-space. Impact with a target forces a full return to normal space, releasing an additional burst of particles that have a devastating electromagnetic and gravitic impact, shutting off subsystems and tearing bulkheads to shreds. Fortunately, standard starship shields are enough to negate these phase particles.

The Edict is rumoured amongst superstitious gunnery crews to be ""especially effective against ghosts"", as absurd a notion that is - though, hypothetically, targets capable of being simultaneously hit by the entire realspace and phased components of its projectiles would be devastated by the combined impacts.",,,,

sotf_peon,SHIP,Autonomous AI bomber for use by Domain automated warships. Carries dumbfire mining charges to blast apart asteroids and hostile vessels alike.,,,,
sotf_keeper,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Keeper-class drones were a later-designed answer to one of the main weaknesses of this type of AI warship - fighter squadrons. Able to manufacture cheap and disposable drone fighters on the fly, space superiority could be maintained even with limited carrier support from allied Domain forces.",,,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Amongst the highest-grade of the Domain's war drones, the Cavalier was used primarily to hunt down and eliminate rebel frigates and destroyers that were too well-armed or fast for smaller drones to swarm and take down. Fast and durable enough to pose a serious threat to ships smaller than itself, it falters when engaging other cruisers, where it struggles to trade pound-for-pound.",,,,
