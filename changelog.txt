- Now always succeeds except versus Omega (was: 65% chance, increased or decreased based on attacker/defender ECM ratings)
- Effectiveness of disruption is multiplied by attacker ECM rating and divided by defender ECM rating
- More effectiveness = longer weapon/engine/system disables and longer overloads

- Clarity for integration with Tahlan Shipworks: if player possesses a ship with Daemonic Heart hullmod, Cyberwarfare Protocols notes that it mitigates Hel Scaith remote override attempts against those ships (this effect was implemented a while ago on Tahlan's side - this is just for clarity)

ADAPTIVE NANITE SWARM (aka "Felcesis")
- Increased guilt buildup from satbombing larger planets (now: 1 for size 3, 2 for size 4-5, 3 for size 6-7, 4 for size 8+)
- Certain vanilla decisions now slightly affect guilt: taking the alpha core, waving (or not) at Alviss, giving the planetkiller to the Path or the Knights of Ludd (sum total of these decisions does not reach the invasion threshold without satbombing, selling Sierra or doing the Killa interaction, and inversely can't save the Haunted from being hunted)

- No longer infests enemy ships if they have less than half the fleet point cost of the most powerful enemy ship

- Wispering Grovetender: now somewhat favored versus carrier-heavy fleets
- Pushed out FP threshold where Fel spawns in a weaker form (50 > 60)
- Added settings.json entry for when "guilt madness" causes the Adaptive Nanite Swarm to be perceived as Felcesis (default: 7)

NEW ADAPTIVE NANITE TRAITS:
- HYBRID: A Trickster's Calling - periodically steals missile ammo from enemy ships, emergency phase when reaching half hull
- DEFENSIVE: Mantle of Thorns - incoming shield damage is reflected as EMP arcs and builds up charge to an EMP discharge
- DEFENSIVE: In Sacrifice, Meaning - at high flux, transfer a large amount of flux to a nearby ally
- SUPPORT: Hands of the Drowned - a gravitic minefield assails the player's fleet. Mines add a scaling 10% of soft flux on hit, and pull anything hit towards them
- SUPPORT: The Perfect Storm - on a 30s repeating timer, ALL player ships/fighters overload or have existing overload extended if they're not venting or phased
- SUPPORT: reality_breaker - if not destroyed within 6 minutes, crashes the game (only appears if player saved within the last 15 minutes)

- Leviathan's Bane: added cooldown bar, increased Hidecracker hard flux on hit (15% capacity > 20% capacity), hits on shields now instantly overload frigates for 4s and destroyers for 1s, incoming cryoharpoon now causes ships to back off and phase ships to avoid unphasing, added icons to relevant UI statuses and reloading status notes if prey is nearby (triggering the accelerated reload)

- Fleet commanders in main-menu missions now properly apply their fleet-wide skills (e.g Affix-Haven, Feros)
- Dawn and Dust: added unique Affix-Haven chatter, buffed enemy officers
- Good Hunting: now has a new objectives/tips list if best-score is above 0, mission now fails if ISS Once in a Lullaby is destroyed
- Good Hunting: new Warhorn portrait by Quacken

SIERRA

- Made a(nother) pass over some of Sierra's dialogue and chatter to re-align her character away from excitable naivety and towards phlegmatic music witchery (expect her dialogue to generally be calmer, slightly wiser and with more splashes of witchcraft - and fewer exclamation marks!!!!!!)
- Sierra now calls you "kindred" once she learns you both hear the Music
- Sierra is now less forgiving of satbombing: 1 second chance for satbombing a size 3, immediately leaves if you do it to a size 4 or larger
- New conversations/thoughts: "Used Gate", "Moths", "Mudskipper Spinout"
- Added Dragonfire to list of possible favorite torpedoes
- Sierra now gets excited when she successfully lands a direct hit with a missile of base damage 1000 or higher (i.e Reaper, Hammer, Atropos)... or apologizes if she friendly fires with one

- Can no longer install Neural Interface on Sierra's ships (sorry)

- Sierra (and Project SIREN) now have a selection of relevant admiral skills
- Sierra's level-up moments are now capped to whatever level they would normally bring her to
- Added quips when swapping into the old Brilliant version of the Vow from Dawn and Dust (if cheated in)

DUSTKEEPERS

- Added a new, separate Dustkeeper Burnouts faction for rogue fleets, such as Barrow or Dustkeeper burnout bounties, who are hostile to everyone (including Dustkeepers)
- Increased the number of opportunities to ask about the topics of Dustkeepers and about burnouts - learning about either one adds that faction to the intel screen

- Added Dustkeeper Hatred: the faction whose mission is to preserve life in the Sector now REALLY hates it when you satbomb a size 4+ planet, and become permanently vengeful
- Dustkeeper warminds can now betray the player during combat under specific circumstances (must have triggered Dustkeeper hatred, must be in a favorable position to do so)

- Barrow now starts with Combat Endurance rather than Gunnery Implants (including when fought)

- Barrow starting relations once restored now Favorable (was Suspicious)
- NPC Dustkeeper oldguards in normal Dustkeeper fleets are now level 8 and have Derelict Contingent, like Barrow, spawning in highly-dmodded ships
- Defender (PROX) & Bastillon (PROX) now have less atrocious weapon arcs than their unupgraded versions

- Picket (PROX): increased hull and armor bonuses (15% & 12% > 25% & 20%), now properly begins sacrifice sequence at max flux, fixed explosion hitting multiple times
- Added "Proxy Control Node" battle objective (acts like Hyperwave Transmitter but with Dustkeeper Proxy drones), spawns in Hypnos system/Mia's Star

- Burnout bounty fleets now have normal (well, "normal") DK fleet names ("Rogue Splinter" > "Scrutiny's Shard" or "Mythic's Neutron Wyrms")
- Non-burnout Dustkeepers no longer use phase ships (if added by mods such as Torchships)

- Fixed a few cases of "years" rather than "cycles"
- Fixed text and performance issues during A Memory in Nexerelin's random sector
